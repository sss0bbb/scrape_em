# scrape_em.py

Scrape data from a site that is difficult to use. This is written for a very specific purpose and will not work as a general solution.

## Dependencies

1. python2.7
2. requests `pip install requests` 
3. beautifulsoup `pip install bs4`

## Usage

`python scrape_em.py -u <url>`

`python scrape_em.py -h` for full options

## To Do

1. display progress
2. locally cache results? json?
3. give option for config file definition of args. cmd line can get crowded quickly, especially with long urls
4. get as most data from each page as possible
